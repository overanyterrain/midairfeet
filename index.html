              <p>Employers profit from your time. To get a better part time job, you need a qualification that you don't have. You work to earn money with a job. Sometimes this means getting a part time job, which means working inconvienient hours and being paid low wages. Being paid poorly means having a pay that is not much higher than legal minimums. This is usually the case for most workers. Another point to add, besides the pay, is that the level of staff turnover is high. Not many people stick around to the work environment when compared to full time staff. Often times, convienience goes to full time staff. Part time work is designed to cover the work of full time workers when they are unavailable, not to mention benefits and a better hourly wage. Depending on the place, the work can be boring and dull. This can be disrupting to your everyday life.</p>

It's about the people, first and foremost. Without the people, there would not be any business. That is why the restuarant industry is a people business.</p>

              <p>Belief is making things, practice is doing things and "life is about doing things, not making things" (Aristotle). Belief however is a key ingredient for dopamine production. The purpose of dopamine is to increase effort. The only relation it has to happiness is that happiness is a byproduct of effort. Effort does not lead to happiness, it leads to results. Dopamine therefore leads to results with happiness as a byproduct of effort.</p>

              <p>Dear Reader,</p>

              <p>I've been drinking this cup of grapefruit juice today. It's been sitting here for a while. I got it around 8 AM. Three hours later, it is 11 AM and I still haven't finished it.<br>
              That is because it is bitter and it does taste a lot like grapefruit, which is not a favorite.<br>
              The only difference between eating one and drinking the juice from one is how much bitterness fills your mouth. In other words, you get a full bodied (for your tongue at least) experience in terms of how bitter the grapefruit juice tastes.<br>
              It's sour too.<br>
              Sure does pack a punch though.<br>
              It's refreshing and energizing.<br>
              Gives you a lesson on the phrase "juiced up", and what it truly means.</p>
              
              <p>I've only gotten a bit over half a cup today. I don't think I will be drinking any more though.

              <p>P.S.<br>
              I ended up drinking the entire bottle. Nobody else in the house wanted any.</p>

              <p>At the snap of a finger, I am in a different world. But it doesn't work all the time. It's really a realization.</p>
              <p>It's not about belief all the time.</p>

              <p>Sometimes I don't feel like writing. Writing on the phone creates different results when compared to writing on the desktop that I own. Even when using traditional methods such as pen and paper I find that the tone of my voice differs between these three methods. Typing on the computer can have similar results to writing with a pen. Still, writing with a pen can be more cerebral than using my computer. A laptop would be an interesting control. I don't have one you see. I am thinking now what that would be like... I find that typing on the phone, which I do have, a smartphone that is, results in too much emotional information. It's an overwhelming downpour that I have a hard time controlling. It is disatisfying to try to get down too, to say the least. It's hard to describe right now. Being to backspace all the time is nice. These days I appreciate that more. These days I want to stop writing with the pen altogether. I want to put it down now.</p>

              <p>I love rhyme words. The unique ones especially (the ones with charm). I discovered the other day how similar computer programming is to freestyle rap. The rhyme schemes that come out are positioned in a way where you can predict where the phonetics will land next. Of course this isn't always the case as it is spontaneous and creative. Maybe written raps with a more rigid rhyme scheme would prove to be a better example. The point I am making is that computer programming is similar to rap because of their predictive design. Locating where each rhyme lands can be more mathematical than I thoughts. I never saw it as anything like that. When I did these things it was always about poetry and the alphabets. The only time I thought of math related subjects were in concepts, which I would be writing about, not the design itself.</p>

              <p>I wonder what else I could do with this comparison?</p>

              <p>(Bothered by it often cause the hassle, as unmitigated as it was, didn't cause me to become dizzy enough to swell down to the floor in my plunder as a pawn in this snickering zone.)</p>

              <p><i>***Ideas could grow four limbs as they become more cerebral thereby develop into stages that need to be outlined in detail. This should be discussed later.

              <p>"Guilt is no fairytale", said the broken lion.<br>
                "Neither is misery", the rat added on brightly.</p>
                
              <p>He too was not in good shape but was having a good day. Both of them were huddled under a large tree to block out the rain, but the rain was relentess and it poured hard.</p>
                
              <p>"I mean when does it end?" the lion bellowed, whining in frustration.<br>
                "I've been sitting here for what? 45 minutes already. Christ on a cracker.</p>
                
              <p>The rat nodded politely.</p>
                
              <p>"Yup, yup. Rain won't end. Simply won't." the rat responded.<br>
                "But look on the bright side, doesn't it smell great?<br>
                "It does."<br>
                "And what about after the rain ends? We still have sunlight here so it will be a beautiful scene. Plus, a little water never hurt anyone anyway.<br>
                "Yeah. but it's a bother. he cut in.<br>
                "I think maybe we both needed a little rain today, actually. The weather has been a bit dry these past few days.<br>
                "Okay" the lion replied back.<br>
                "See. Not that bad. Besides, the rain is beautiful anyway."</p>
                
              <p>Both of them sat in silence, until the leaves of the trees became so full of rainwater that the drops began to pitter patter on both the Rat and the Lion.</p>
                
              <p>They both looked on ahead, waiting for the rain to end. And in about a minute the rain began to settle.</p>

              <p>The rat and the lion were good friends, believe it or not. This is because the Lion was timid and annoyed with being a lion. The Rat on the other hand was always cheerful and did not mind his company.</p>
                
              <p>"Chester." The lion cried. "Why do we eat vegetarians."</p>
                
              <p>Chester shuddered at the idea of Craig eating him. Rarely did he think about the danger it was to sit down next to a lion, but he was ambitious and brave and he liked adventure. To him, it was just another accomplishment. And an accomplishment it was. Gladly, he wasn't a vegetarian. He was an omnivore.</p>
                
              <p>"Because they taste good I guess." Chester replied.<br>
                "Yeah but I like potatoes."<br>
                "I guess your Mom and Dad had too many vegetarians and gave birth to one" Chester chuckled.<br>
                "Yeah."<br>
                "Yeah." Chester echoed back.</p>
                
              <p>The both of them sat in silence waiting for something to happen in front of them. Maybe a large bird would choose to nest in front of them for a bit.
                
              <p>"Chester..." Craig spoke.<br>
                "What man."<br>
                "Do you know if birds have buttcheeks?"</p>
                
              <p>Chester giggled.</p>
                
              <p>"You should ask one to show their buttcheeks."<br>
                "Totally. When a bird flies over I'll ask him"<br>
                "Dude, I dare you to."<br>
                "Psh, that's nothing."</p>
                
              <p>And so they both waited and waited for a bird to appear. And then a small flock of pigeons showed up.
                
              <p>"Hey show us your buttcheeks!" he screamed.</p>
                
              <p>The bird who were pecking at the ground paused for a moment and looked in their direction. Chester and Craig were hoping for them to resume back to their pecking but they did not. One bird however turned right around and raised his tail feathers up high. They would soon find this bird's name to be Greg.</p>
                
              <p>The pigeon reached out with both wings and spread his cheeks.</p>
                
              <p>"Dude, look! He's doing it." Craig said, poking at Chester with his paw.<br>
                "Man, what is that."<br>
                "Seriously man, it's bird butt."<br>
                "But this is more than we asked for, what the..."<br>
                "Woah."<br>
                "Woah indeed" the daring pigeon said. "Now return the favor."</p>
                
              <p>Both of them were stunned by this as Greg the Pigeon walked up to them. The tip of his beak was plastered with mud. The other birds shook their heads in silence and resumed to their pecking.</p>
                
                
              <p>"Now, we don't have all day, you see." he said. "The sun will be setting soon."<br>
                "Are you going to do it, Craig?" Chester squeaked<br>
                "Um. I guess." he mumbled.<br>
                "You have no self-respect!"</p>
                
              <p>Craig who was now wondering about his life choices turned around and spread his buttcheeks with both paws. He did his best to avoid getting any mud on his face, so he held his head a few inches above the ground. It was not as uncomfortable a position than he previously assumed it to be.</p>
                
                
              <p>"Good. Now for the other."<br>
                "No way! I'm not doing that!" Chester squeaked again.<br>
                "Fine, I am satisfied anyway." Greg said lying to himself.</p>
                
              <p>And this is when Greg walked up to them even closer.</p>
                
              <p>"GREG! STOP!" One of the birds cried, but Greg did not. He continued to walk closer and he did it step by step.</p>
                
              <p>"Now listen here you turd eating cat, we don't have any time for your jokes. Either you sit down here with your turd covered paws and do this every day when we show up or you leave this area cause this is my territory now. I own you and your friend"</p>
                
              <p>Greg was a bully.</p>
                
              <p>"Oh, but I guess you can't huh. Not enough room here in your little hole of a dwelling place?" Well guess what bub, time is up. Now you do what I tell you to do. This tree is ours, we're taking it. C'mon boys!" He hollered waving a wing in the air.</p>
                
              <p>The other pigeons raised their heads up and looked at his direction. Then after some silence resumed back to their pecking again.</p>
                
              <p>"Mushrooms!" he stomped. "Fine, just know one thing" the powerless bird said. "This tree is still mine."</p>
              <p>"Wait what?" they questioned.</p>
              <p>"Now MOVE!"</p>
                
              <p>And so, both Chester and Craig walked away from the tree to another place of shade. This time close to the wall under an inadequete piece of ceiling. They lived in a zoo.</p>
                
              <p>"Oh yeah and guess what?" Greg said. "You both live in a zoo!" he said cackling under the tree previously occupied by both Chester and Craig.</p>
              
              <p>"Craig, your so lame." Chester said.<br>
                "Why did he show us his butthole?" whimpered Craig. As they both stood under the piece of ceiling next to the wall.</p>
                
              <p>Moral of the story: Don't ask a pigeon to show his buttcheeks.</p>

              <p>Sometimes "what worries you, masters you", as said by Haddon Robinson. To become enslaved by worry is not a happy life. There is no distinct connection to wisdom, the supreme form of happiness. There is long term financial freedom in worry. There is no balance when you become eaten alive by it.</p>

              <p>Lately I have been reading books. I say reading but I also listen to audiobooks. My intake is that in relation to books.</p>

              <p>Here are some of my favorite books:</p>

              <p>FICTION
                 - The Phantom Tollbooth by Norton Juster<br>
                 - The Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry<br>
                 - Where The Red Fern Grows by Wilson Rawls<br>
                 - Slaughterhouse V by Kurt Vonnegut<br>
                 - Alice In Wonderland by Lewis Carroll</p>
                
              <p>NON FICTION
                 - Night by Elie Wiesel</p>

              <hr>
              <p>Does good art always have to be thought provoking? It sure is sensible to create that kind of art. I'm wondering now about other kinds that are out there. The ones that bring an emotion out of you. Often, I view the world in a scientific way and this makes me wonder about my own senses. My empathy.</p>

              <p>Can a painting bring me to tears?</p>

              <hr>
              <p>"<i>Never be afraid to trust an unknown future to a known God.</i>"<br>
              - Corrie ten Boom</p>

              <p>"<i>The harder you fall, the higher you bounce.</i>"<br>
              - Anonymous</p>

              <p>"<i>Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one's courage.</i>"<br>
              - Anais Nin</p>
              <hr>
              <hr>
              <p>If you love life, don't waste time because it is made up of time.</p>
              <hr>
              <hr>
              <p>Sugar doesn't love you back. Neither do chunks of silicone. What part does love play in all of this? Is humor a necessary ingredient of biological life in this galaxy where I was born? When love is at the center of cognition, efficiency emerges. When it comes to discussing how Love is related throughout the galaxy, there is no need to become politically dense about it. There are nations, agencies, corporations full of people, zombie institutions, family units, and marriages, yet political language is ineffective when it comes to discussing these interconnections. Collections and collections of people all began with one relationship, and this relationship can blossom into the potential for more.</p>

              <p><i>As the rainfall gains weight it loses it's shape in almost an instant.<br>
                Welcome to March, where it is spring time.<br>
                In March, birds begin to mix around in the grassy areas of the city.<br>
                Girls start wearing skirts again.<br>
                In March, the wind is still chilly but the sun starts to peek out.</i></p>
              <p>In an effort to approach life in a scientific way instead of it being related to art, I've come to this website once again to write about another topic. Of course I had to settle for writing a light poem about the month of March beforehand.</p>
              <p>I will be blunt.</p> 
              <p>I am not a scientific man nor do I have the coherency to burst out in eloquence or fun facts. Especially when it comes to my speaking voice (the real one). If I had advice to give people, I would tell them to speak of courage and to keep their fears out of conversation. But you know how impulsive people can be. Avoiding subjects that leave you depressed or dull can be difficult for a lot of poeple. I myself am a person that follows an impulse, and in my attempts to conquer it, I find that I have only suppressed it into an irritant that does bother me. It runs me off the tracks of life and broods into a stress of life. One of a few that I can point out now off the top of my mind. I am not sure what it means to be scientific, besides hopscotching around between concept after concept or quote to quote. My method of approach to life is a creative one. I think all people are creative. I think God created people with a pedestrian design in mind. Some animals were made for flying, so God gave them wings. We human beings were born as bipedal animals and we were meant to walk. Therefore to remain durable, we should walk and not just sit around for the clock to stop ticking.</p>
              <p>I would not like to write relentlessly and overindulge in the impulse and self torture that I can take pleasure from. That kind of pleasure is short lived and is usually destructive. I also do not want to come off as pretentious, the same way I used to write as kid as a result of listening to and almost worshipping the public speaker named Alan Watts, who specialized in Zen Buddhism and spoke of his learnings during the 70s.</p>
              <p>I created this website with an intention in mind. That is to remain a hidden gem of the internet. It is not a blog or a journal. It is just a place to broadcast this creative side of mine. If it grows popular among a thousand, I would be stunned.</p>
              <p>If I told others to broadcast their desire to eat sandwiches on this website, how many people would be amused by it? Of course, it would be a pleasure to know that people smile while reading the material that I come up with. That smile could be because they thought something was funny, sweet, or just amusing. People smile for different reasons. A smile does not indicate one emotion. There are many reasons a person could smile.<p>
              <p>I write this now and wonder to myself whether I have sparked the imagination of others or not. It is not my desire to cause inspiration, but thinking about it now that would be a nice byproduct.</p>
              <p>What does it mean anyway, to spark the imagination of other people?</p>
