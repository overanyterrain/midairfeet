              <p>Employers profit from your time. To get a better part time job, you need a qualification that you don't have. You work to earn money with a job. Sometimes this means getting a part time job, which means working inconvienient hours and being paid low wages. Being paid poorly means having a pay that is not much higher than legal minimums. This is usually the case for most workers. Another point to add, besides the pay, is that the level of staff turnover is high. Not many people stick around to the work environment when compared to full time staff. Often times, convienience goes to full time staff. Part time work is designed to cover the work of full time workers when they are unavailable, not to mention benefits and a better hourly wage. Depending on the place, the work can be boring and dull. This can be disrupting to your everyday life.</p>

              <p>Belief is making things, practice is doing things and "life is about doing things, not making things" (Aristotle). Belief however is a key ingredient for dopamine production. The purpose of dopamine is to increase effort. The only relation it has to happiness is that happiness is a byproduct of effort. Effort does not lead to happiness, it leads to results. Dopamine therefore leads to results with happiness as a byproduct of effort.</p>

              <p>Dear Reader,</p>

              <p>I've been drinking this cup of grapefruit juice today. It's been sitting here for a while. I got it around 8 AM. Three hours later, it is 11 AM and I still haven't finished it.<br>
              That is because it is bitter and it does taste a lot like grapefruit, which is not a favorite.<br>
              The only difference between eating one and drinking the juice from one is how much bitterness fills your mouth. In other words, you get a full bodied (for your tongue at least) experience in terms of how bitter the grapefruit juice tastes.<br>
              It's sour too.<br>
              Sure does pack a punch though.<br>
              It's refreshing and energizing.<br>
              Gives you a lesson on the phrase "juiced up", and what it truly means.</p>
              
              <p>I've only gotten a bit over half a cup today. I don't think I will be drinking any more though.

              <p>P.S.<br>
              I ended up drinking the entire bottle. Nobody else in the house wanted any.</p>

              <p>At the snap of a finger, I am in a different world. But it doesn't work all the time. It's really a realization.</p>
              <p>It's not about belief all the time.</p>

              <p>Sometimes I don't feel like writing. Writing on the phone creates different results when compared to writing on the computer that I own. Even when using traditional methods such as pen and paper, I find that the tone of my voice differs between these three methods. Typing on the computer can have similar results to writing with a pen I've discovered. Still, writing with a pen can be cerebral as opposed to typing on the computer. A laptop would be an interesting control. I don't have one though. I am thinking now what that would be like... I find that typing on the phone, which I do have, a smartphone that is, results in too much emotional information. It's an overwhelming downpour that I have a hard time controlling. It is disatisfying to try to get down information. It's hard to describe how annoying it is.</p>

              <p>I love rhyme words. The unique ones especially (the ones with charm). I discovered the other day how similar computer programming is to freestyle rap. The rhyme schemes that come out are positioned in a way where you can predict where the phonetics will land next. Of course this isn't always the case as it is spontaneous and creative. Maybe written raps with a more rigid rhyme scheme would prove to be a better example. The point I am making is that computer programming is similar to rap because of their predictive design. Locating where each rhyme lands can be more mathematical than I thought. I never saw it as anything like that. When I did these things it was always about poetry and the alphabet. The only time I thought of math related subjects were in concepts, which I would be writing about, not the design itself.</p>

              <p>I wonder what else I could do with this comparison?</p>
