  <p>There are many places poetry could hide.<br>
  Just like a shadow can be hiding in our mouths, poetry can hide in there as well.<br>
  A shadow is supposed to follow you, you know.<br>
  But sometimes it hides in there.</p>

  <p>Anyway, other places are in a sock drawer for instance.</p>

  <p>It can hide in a bamboo tree. That is something hollow.<br>
  People use it to make pipes.<br>
  Pipes that can be used for many things.<br>
  Purposes such as water pipes.<br>
  Pipes meant for smoking with.<br>
  It can also be used as a container for liquids, such as alcohol.</p>

  <p>I am thinking about drugs now.</p>

  <p>Poetry can hide in other places. Not just in the mouth or sock drawers. Not even something as simple as the mind.</p>

  <p>Poetry can hide in a lightbulb that has not been lit yet.<br>
  It can hide in broken emotions. The broken kind of person that has to deal with stockholm syndrome everyday.<br>
  That is me..</p>

  <p>Poetry can hide in others places.</p>

  <p>Places like books.<br>
  I smell poetry today.<br>
  That is the smell of a good book.</p>

  <p>Poetry is a word that I can describe like this.<br>
  It has 6 letters, strung together like a necklace.<br>
  What if every letter was a flower?</p>

  <p>Employers profit from your time. To get a better part time job, you need a qualification that you don't have. You work to earn money with a job. Sometimes this means getting a part time job, which means working inconvienient hours and being paid low wages. Being paid poorly means having a pay that is not much higher than legal minimums. This is usually the case for most workers. Another point to add, besides the pay, is that the level of staff turnover is high. Not many people stick around to the work environment when compared to full time staff. Often times, convienience goes to full time staff. Part time work is designed to cover the work of full time workers when they are unavailable, not to mention benefits and a better hourly wage. Depending on the place, the work can be boring and dull. This can be disrupting to your everyday life.</p>

  <p>I might make a digital painting, which is amateur stuff, and then I might delete this painting. I do the same thing when I make music (I use FL Studio) sometimes. Why do I do this? The simple answer would be because I feel like it, but I could define it to a greater point, which would bottle down to direction. I think a little about direction these days. It is important to me and I would not like to overwhelm myself with it. This could be done easily. That is because I get obsessive quickly, especially when it comes to music.</p>

  <p>A good way to get ideas rolling is to start by copying others. When I am looking for ideas, that is before the gathering, this is what I do.<br>
  I do this when I am writing. I may look at a picture and start writing about it. Naturally, I do not do this all the time but it is great to look back on the material I have come up with. Many times I find out how original I really can be. This applies to writing or drawing or making music. I'm sure it could apply to teaching as well as cooking.<br>
  I look back on my previous work when I was in high school and smirk at how pretentious it sounded. I didn't even know how pretentious it sounded at the time, with my young brain. (Brains stop developing at the age of 25, so here we go.) All the uneccesary adjectives I used... it's funny to me.<br>
  Coming up with that kind of stuff, no doubt about it was a lot of fun still.<br>
  What do I do these days?<br>
  Not much. Pretty much nothing. I do stuff do get to the nothing I do now in my free time.<br>
  I enjoy self discipline when I can stick to the principles. Not so much when it comes to instruction, I have to say.<br>
  I went from writing in sand and dirt to writing with graphite to ink to and finally to pixels. I also draw with these things.<br>
  What a progression!</p>

  <p>Dear Reader,</p>

  <p>I've been drinking this cup of grapefruit juice today. It's been sitting here for a while. I got it around 8 AM. Three hours later, it is 11 AM and I still haven't finished it.<br>
    That is because it is bitter and it does taste a lot like grapefruit, which is not a favorite.<br>
    The only difference between eating one and drinking the juice from one is how much bitterness fills your mouth. In other words, you get a full bodied (for your tongue at least) experience in terms of how bitter the grapefruit juice tastes.<br>
    It's sour too.<br>
    Sure does pack a punch though.<br>
    It's refreshing and energizing.<br>
    Gives you a lesson on the phrase "juiced up", and what it truly means</p>. 
    
  <p>I've only gotten a bit over half a cup today. I don't think I will be drinking any more though.

  <p>P.S.<br>
    I ended up drinking the entire bottle. Nobody else in the house wanted any.</p>
    <hr>
    <hr>
  <p>I wish I were the old me, not really a kid but a manchild that could get away with the trouble I could cause. That is because I was not a real adult yet and trouble as in getting away with not paying any rent. Or smoking bud. I would be listening to music without a care in the world with a low income rent that I would pay my mother with. I would work a part time job and put in minimum effort because of how cynical I would be. Because of drug habits and abuse of middle class privelages like listening to music too much. These sort of things did not set the fuse off guilt at the time. I would be enjoying the smell of coffee, drinking it on a regular basis, whenever I wanted. The time of the day would not matter to me. Sure, I would have a set of personal rules though. No doubt about that. 
<ol> 
  <li>No going to 7-11 except for emergencies, because it is the place to go to if you would like to waste your money. What a gamble it is to go there...</li> 
  <li>Keep all your 5 dollar bills just in case I meet a girl.</li> 
 </ol>   
  <p>Things like this.</p> 
  
  <p>I would be eating junk food in my room. Sneaking them in without really having the concept of sneaking them in, in my mind. I would just be taking it to my room to eat later. None of my problems would have mattered. Atrocities and little things I did in the past wouldn't matter because I wouldn't be thinking of them. None of them would have been on my mind. Not like today.</p> 
    
  <p>My self-maintenance would mainly apply to time management. Personal hygiene would be done with so little effort put into it that I would probably never wash my face every morning. ...and you know, I probably wouldn't brush my teeth either.</p>

  <p>Imagine if I were a kid though.</p> 
  
  <p>If I could do it again, except this time with the abilities I currently have. If I had that, then I wouldn't I also have the guilt that comes with the knowledge and experience required to gather my skills. And if I were cruel enough, that kind of guilt would not affect me in the slightest. And if this happened I would conquer Earth.</p>

  <p>I could imagine myself as something like a wind instrument. I reflect on that one episode from Spongebob, where a dozen or so Spongebob statues made of stone stood in the grass plains. Heavy wind flowed through the holes in the statues emitting a special. Each one played a different note and when heavy wind flowed through all of them, they played a song together in unison.</p>

  <p>Clarinets let the wind flow through them. Pianos play in chords.</p>

  <p>Before the Recorder from elementary school, the Piano was an instrument I played. My older brother played it and I wanted to be like him.</p> 
  
  <p>It was my first instrument.</p>

  <p>At the snap of a finger, I am in a different world. But it doesn't work all the time. It's really a realization. It's not about belief.</p>

  <p>I sleep with one blanket from now on. The thing is it used to be two. I have a thin one, which is currently in use and a thick one that I folded up and put to the side. It belongs somewhere else though. Like a closet or something.</p>

  <p>Sometimes I don't feel like writing. Writing on the phone creates different results when compared to writing on the desktop that I own. Even when using traditional methods such as pen and paper I find that the tone of my voice differs between these three methods. Typing on the computer can have similar results to writing with a pen. Still, writing with a pen can be more cerebral than using my computer. A laptop would be an interesting control. I don't have one you see. I am thinking now what that would be like... I find that typing on the phone, which I do have, a smartphone that is, results in too much emotional information. It's an overwhelming downpour that I have a hard time controlling. It is disatisfying to try to get down too, to say the least. It's hard to describe right now. Being to backspace all the time is nice. These days I appreciate that more. These days I want to stop writing with the pen altogether. I want to put it down now.</p>
    <hr>
    <hr>
  <p>I love rhyme words. Especially unique ones. I discovered the other day how similar computer programming is to freestyle rap. The rhyme schemes that come out are positioned in a way where you can predict where the phonetics will land next. Of course this isn't always the case as it is spontaneous and creative. Maybe written raps with a more rigid rhyme scheme would prove to be a better example. The point I am making is that computer programming is similar to rap because of their predictive design. Locating where each rhyme lands can be more mathematical than I thoughts. I never saw it as anything like that. When I did these things it was always about poetry and the alphabets. The only time I thought of math related subjects were in concepts, which I would be writing about, not the design itself.</p>

  <p>I wonder what else I could do with this comparison?</p>

  <p>(Bothered by it often cause the hassle, as unmitigated as it was, didn't cause me to become dizzy enough to swell down to the floor in my plunder as a pawn in this snickering zone.)</p>

  <p>How would you learn what fool's gold is without the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz2nNNj7O8o"target="_blank">eyes</a> to see color, or the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgUcK5g-HWU"target="_blank">hands</a> to reach out for it.</p>

  <p>(Give away a definite yes if you dare to mulch past the judgement that could easily corrupt the christians under a daytime sham run by three centuries of democracy.)</p>

  <p><i>***Ideas could grow four limbs as they become more cerebral thereby develop into stages that need to be outlined in detail. This should be discussed later. Ideas that pester and sort of haunt you, in their own special way, could develop and learn their own advanced defense mechanisms and eventually the sight of this would become boring quickly as time progressed and other technological discoveries are made.***</i></p>

  <p>My social behavior is like a ceramic plate. It gets dirty but you can clean it off with soap. I'm not implying that I eat soap on a regular basis. In fact, I don't eat soap. I did have a nightmare once where I had to eat soap all the time though. That was the only food I could eat at the time. And I was enslaved by mysterious people who I never thought about then.</p>

  <p>I wrote to be cool a few years ago and it was cool to be unique. Now I write to relieve the mind of thoughts. But I still have cravings to be cool, so sometimes I find myself writing to be cool again. It's the unique thoughts that I want to be able to revisit. Maybe to mark pinpoints in my quest of self identification. I am usually lost these days and am losing grip of reality and who I am. I feel disheartened and almost under a terrible spell of boredom, brain fog and frequently peeing. Still, out of this spell comes gold and that would be my hidden strengths. Still, life is hard and it seems like knowing my strengths under this kind of pressure is not worthwhile. I am maybe too slow for life. I do travel at my own pace after all. Which... is slow.</p>

  <p>I regret smoking weed and doing with other drugs. They did change the person I used to be and altered who I was supposed to be. It was effective in distorting the truth I was born with. "All people know the same truth, said Woody Allen. Our lives consists of how we choose to distort it."</p>

  <p><i>Why do I write?</i> Another question that needs answering to is "<i>What do I write</i>"?</p>

  <p>I write these entries which are a cross between journal entries and blog posts and random thoughts as generous as they come. I write a couple bars here and there. Rap stuff. I write rhymes. Multisyllabics. And I collected these to the point of insanity. I still write these kinds of rhymes for the fun of it but not as intensily as I once did. The pinnacle of rhyme writing must have been in 12th grade of high school, however I was not as skilled when I compare it to a few years later into my community college days. That's where I really got good at it.</p>

  <p><i>What else do I write?</i></p>

  <p>I write poems. I actually prefer to call my rap "bars" couplets. Even though they are not exactly poems.</p>

  <p>I write different kinds of poems. Whatever I am feeling at the time. I have a variety of different poem types at my hand. What I mean is things like haikus, free write, or the ones that rhyme at the end with a steady measurement between every line. I don't know what they're called.</p>

  <p>I feel like I could be talking to someone in my writing. I could be eloquent enough to speak like this in real life to another person. But you know, the visual stimuli can be overwhelming these days. Maybe because I sit in front of my computer all day and look at naked pictures of women all the time and never talk to people. Not even my family. And I should.</p>

  <p>I guess I do sometimes. The deepest conversation that I've had in these recent days were with my older brother. We spoke about computer knowledge and a bit about the engineering side of things. I told him a bit about my involvement with Codecademy and learning Python and he supported the idea to the best of his abilities. I couldn't help but feel that he was hiding an anger inside however. As if he did not want me to learn computer engineering or anything related to computer science. Anyway, my computer was the focal point and the seed of our conversation. That is because I had a problem with the operating system I was using and effectively I had crippled my computer.</p>

  <p>It was nice to go through that experience, and by meeting this error, and the errors do persist, I come to know resilience. I also understand that meeting these kinds of errors forced me to change my belief system and other things such as focusing on posture while speaking over the phone. Everybody knows a smile shows through a phone call but what about posture?</p>

  <p>Speaking of posture, I remember a thing about having good posture. Imagine a string that runs through the top of your head and through your body down to your feet. This string runs vertically. The string is sometimes loose. Make sure it is straight.</p>

  <p>Does that even apply if your sitting down?</p>

  <p>I guess it does but the string would have to come out of your butt.</p>

  <p>Some days do not smell like poetry at all.</p>

<p>Do not be a pinecone.<br>
  You will get stepped on by kids.<br>
  I have heard the crunch a thousands times in the morning.<br>
  While the kids walk to school, I have heard this.<br>
  Some were young children.<br>
  Others were high schoolers.<br>
  They have both done similar things. And that is stepping on pinecones.<br>
  So do not be a pinecone.<br>
  This is because you will be stepped on by kids.</p>

  <p>"Guilt is no fairytale", said the broken lion.<br>
    "Neither is misery", the rat added on brightly.</p>
    
  <p>He too was not in good shape but was having a good day. Both of them were huddled under a large tree to block out the rain, but the rain was relentess and it poured hard.</p>
    
  <p>"I mean when does it end?" the lion bellowed, whining in frustration.<br>
    "I've been sitting here for what? 45 minutes already. Christ on a cracker.</p>
    
    <p>The rat nodded politely.</p>
    
    <p>"Yup, yup. Rain won't end. Simply won't." the rat responded.<br>
    "But look on the bright side, doesn't it smell great?<br>
    "It does."<br>
    "And what about after the rain ends? We still have sunlight here so it will be a beautiful scene. Plus, a little water never hurt anyone anyway.<br>
    "Yeah. but it's a bother. he cut in.<br>
    "I think maybe we both needed a little rain today, actually. The weather has been a bit dry these past few days.<br>
    "Okay" the lion replied back.<br>
    "See. Not that bad. Besides, the rain is beautiful anyway."</p>
    
  <p>Both of them sat in silence, until the leaves of the trees became so full of rainwater that the drops began to pitter patter on both the Rat and the Lion.</p>
    
  <p>They both looked on ahead, waiting for the rain to end. And in about a minute the rain began to settle.</p>

  <p>The rat and the lion were good friends, believe it or not. This is because the Lion was timid and annoyed with being a lion. The Rat on the other hand was always cheerful and did not mind his company.</p>
    
  <p>"Chester." The lion cried. "Why do we eat vegetarians."</p>
    
  <p>Chester shuddered at the idea of Craig eating him. Rarely did he think about the danger it was to sit down next to a lion, but he was ambitious and brave and he liked adventure. To him, it was just another accomplishment. And an accomplishment it was. Gladly, he wasn't a vegetarian. He was an omnivore.</p>
    
  <p>"Because they taste good I guess." Chester replied.<br>
    "Yeah but I like potatoes."<br>
    "I guess your Mom and Dad had too many vegetarians and gave birth to one" Chester chuckled.<br>
    "Yeah."<br>
    "Yeah." Chester echoed back.</p>
    
  <p>The both of them sat in silence waiting for something to happen in front of them. Maybe a large bird would choose to nest in front of them for a bit.
    
  <p>"Chester..." Craig spoke.<br>
    "What man."<br>
    "Do you know if birds have buttcheeks?"</p>
    
  <p>Chester giggled.</p>
    
  <p>"You should ask one to show their buttcheeks."<br>
    "Totally. When a bird flies over I'll ask him"<br>
    "Dude, I dare you to."<br>
    "Psh, that's nothing."</p>
    
  <p>And so they both waited and waited for a bird to appear. And then a small flock of pigeons showed up.
    
  <p>"Hey show us your buttcheeks!" he screamed.</p>
    
  <p>The bird who were pecking at the ground paused for a moment and looked in their direction. Chester and Craig were hoping for them to resume back to their pecking but they did not. One bird however turned right around and raised his tail feathers up high. They would soon find this bird's name to be Greg.</p>
    
  <p>The pigeon reached out with both wings and spread his cheeks.</p>
    
  <p>"Dude, look! He's doing it." Craig said, poking at Chester with his paw.<br>
    "Man, what is that."<br>
    "Seriously man, it's bird butt."<br>
    "But this is more than we asked for, what the..."<br>
    "Woah."<br>
    "Woah indeed" the daring pigeon said. "Now return the favor."</p>
    
  <p>Both of them were stunned by this as Greg the Pigeon walked up to them. The tip of his beak was plastered with mud. The other birds shook their heads in silence and resumed to their pecking.</p>
    
    
  <p>"Now, we don't have all day, you see." he said. "The sun will be setting soon."<br>
    "Are you going to do it, Craig?" Chester squeaked<br>
    "Um. I guess." he mumbled.<br>
    "You have no self-respect!"</p>
    
  <p>Craig who was now wondering about his life choices turned around and spread his buttcheeks with both paws. He did his best to avoid getting any mud on his face, so he held his head a few inches above the ground. It was not as uncomfortable a position than he previously assumed it to be.</p>
    
    
  <p>"Good. Now for the other."<br>
    "No way! I'm not doing that!" Chester squeaked again.<br>
    "Fine, I am satisfied anyway." Greg said lying to himself.</p>
    
  <p>And this is when Greg walked up to them even closer.</p>
    
  <p>"GREG! STOP!" One of the birds cried, but Greg did not. He continued to walk closer and he did it step by step.</p>
    
  <p>"Now listen here you turd eating cat, we don't have any time for your jokes. Either you sit down here with your turd covered paws and do this every day when we show up or you leave this area cause this is my territory now. I own you and your friend"</p>
    
  <p>Greg was a bully.</p>
    
  <p>"Oh, but I guess you can't huh. Not enough room here in your little hole of a dwelling place?" Well guess what bub, time is up. Now you do what I tell you to do. This tree is ours, we're taking it. C'mon boys!" He hollered waving a wing in the air.</p>
    
  <p>The other pigeons raised their heads up and looked at his direction. Then after some silence resumed back to their pecking again.</p>
    
  <p>"God Mushrooms!" he stomped. "Fine, just know one thing" the powerless bird said. "This tree is still mine."</p>
    "Wait what?"
    "Now MOVE!"</p>
    
  <p>And so, both Chester and Craig walked away from the tree to another place of shade. This time close to the wall under an inadequete piece of ceiling. They lived in a zoo.</p>
    
  <p>"Oh yeah and guess what?" Greg said. "You both live in a zoo!" he said cackling under the tree previously occupied by both Chester and Craig.</p>
  
  <p>"Craig, your so lame." Chester said.<br>
    "Why did he show us his butthole?" whimpered Craig. As they both stood under the piece of ceiling next to the wall.</p>
    
  <p>Moral of the story: Don't ask a pigeon to show his buttcheeks.</p>

  <p>Sometimes "what worries you, masters you", as said by Haddon Robinson. To become enslaved by worry is not a happy life. There is no distinct connection to wisdom, the supreme form of happiness. There is long term financial freedom in worry. There is no balance when you become eaten alive by it.</p>

  <p>Stay true to yourself<br>
    Follow your heart<br>
    Keep it real<br>
    Act naturally<br>
    Don't worry about it<br>
    It's ok</p>
    
  <p>These are all saying the same things</p>
