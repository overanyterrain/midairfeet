		        <p>Always at a foot, above your little head,<br>
			           the deer will come around, and eat your salad greens.<br>
			           They bounce and prance and stuff like that with energy to spend,<br>
			           And sometimes, they munch on blocks of cheese.</p>

                <p>This corner of mine is a dunce cap corner and I've explored it a bit, and now my mornings are weird.
            <br>
		        <p>I try my best to focus on living but then I start throwing fits at my corner.</p>

  		        <p>That fit is actually a chair.</p>

                <p>There are many places poetry could hide.<br>
                  <br>
                    It can hide in a bamboo tree.<br>
                  <br>
                    Poetry can hide in a lightbulb that has not been lit yet.<br>
                  <br>
                    Poetry hides in my line of vision.<br>
                  <br>
                    You can find it in plain sight.<br>
                  <br>
                    Nature brings surprises, and this can be a gift.</p>

                <p>Money is a measurement of our work. It is a unit of measurement, and a unit of measurement that is continually changing cannot perform its function well.

                    The US dollar had a fixed value to gold until 1971. After severing this relationship, the government threw the dollar and the economy on a never-ending roller-coaster ride.
                    
                    Fun Fact: Gold used to be illegal to own in the 1970s in the USA.</p>

              <p>Sometimes "what worries you, masters you", as said by Haddon Robinson. To become enslaved by worry is not a happy life. There is no distinct connection to wisdom, the supreme form of happiness. There is long term financial freedom in worry. There is no balance when you become eaten alive by it.</p>

                Baguettes are swords made of bread<br>

                    Welcome to March, where it is spring time.<br>
                    In March, birds begin to mix around in the grassy areas of the city.<br>
                    Girls start wearing skirts again.<br>
                    In March, the wind is still chilly but the sun starts to peek out.</p>

                <p>I follow an impulse, and in attempts to conquer it I have found that suppression irritates me. It runs me off the tracks of life and broods into stress.<br>

                    I think God created people with a pedestrian design in mind. Some animals were made for flying, so God gave them wings. Human beings were born as bipedal animals and we were meant to walk.<br>
                    
                    I'd like to not write relentlessly and overindulge in a self torture. That kind of pleasure would destroy me.</p>
